                <p class="img-text">During Operation Market Garden, the British
                1st Airborne Division, led by Lieutenant Colonel John Frost,
                held the Rhine Bridge at Arnhem against fierce German resistance.
                Despite being vastly outnumbered, they managed to maintain control
                for four days until a ceasefire allowed evacuation of wounded soldiers,
                including Frost. The bridge was later renamed the John Frost Bridge in his honor.</p>
